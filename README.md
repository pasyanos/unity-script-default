My preferred template for Unity scripts. I prefer to organize my classes with regions, and do not want any additional libraries or Unity method callbacks included by default, so that I can add exactly what I need as I need it.

It should be placed in the `%EDITOR_PATH%\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates` folder in the file ` 81-C# Script-NewBehaviourScript.cs.txt`.
